# Technical Analysis Manager
When doing technical analysis on assets such as stocks, you have to deal with a 
lot of numbers and other data. There are indicators to look at to create 
signals, which in turn informs you of a suggested decision on whether to buy, 
hold or sell an asset. It can be quite unwieldy to keep track of all that, 
especially if you have a lot of different assets and if you look at many 
indicators before you make a decision (as you should). This application will 
help you do just that.
