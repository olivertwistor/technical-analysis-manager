# Technical Analysis Manager
When doing technical analysis on assets such as stocks, you have to deal with a lot of numbers and data. There are indicators to look at to create signals, which in turn informs you of a suggested decision on whether to buy, hold or sell an asset. It can be quite unwieldy to keep track of all that, especially if you have a lot of different assets and if you look at many indicators before you make a decision (as you should). This application will help you do just that.

You can't do technical analysis with this application. There are plenty of other applications and websites where you can do that. This is for keeping track of the products of your analyses.
